# frontend-casus-nostradamus

This repository is a code assessment for a frontend development jobinterview. The assigment was to make a to do list application in VueJS with the following requirements and functionality: 

- Add new items
- Update or edit items
- Check items
- Delete items

There were no design requirements so I chose to focus mainly on functionality. I chose to write the assignment in Vue 3 with typescript and use the Pinia store for state management. 

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
yarn lint
```
